	"description": "Adds the Crude Transport Belt, a tier below the normal Transport Belt. This is a very cheap but slow transport belt to allow easier early automation and item transportation. The speed is 1/3 of the normal Transport Belt, which is 5 items/s. The exact crafting cost and amount of crafted items is configurable, so you can adjust it to be cheap or even expensive, or adjust it to fit in with costs of other mods you might have."
