crude-transport-belt-enable-nogear=Enable or disable the [color=green]Only Iron Plate[/color] recipe, enabled by default. You can activate multiple recipes if you want, they can be used alone or together. This recipe will allow you to craft Crude Transport Belts for just Iron Plates. The cost and craft amount can be modified with the multipliers below.
crude-transport-belt-cost-nogear-ironplate=Multiplies the cost of Iron Plates used in the [color=green]Only Iron Plate[/color] crafting recipe. The default cost is 1 Iron Plate which is then multiplied by this value.
crude-transport-belt-result-nogear=Multiplies the crafted amount of Crude Transport Belts in the [color=green]Only Iron Plate[/color] crafting recipe. The default amount is 1 belt which is then multiplied by this value.
crude-transport-belt-enable-cheap=Enable or disable the [color=blue]Iron Plate and Gear[/color] recipe, disabled by default. You can activate multiple recipes if you want, they can be used alone or together. This recipe will allow you to craft Crude Transport Belts for Iron Plates and Iron Gear Wheels, the same as normal Transport Belts. The cost and craft amount can be modified with the multipliers below.
crude-transport-belt-cost-cheap-ironplate=Multiplies the cost of Iron Plates used in the [color=blue]Iron Plate and Gear[/color] crafting recipe. The default cost is 1 Iron Plate which is then multiplied by this value.
crude-transport-belt-cost-cheap-irongear=Multiplies the cost of Iron Gear Wheels used in the [color=blue]Iron Plate and Gear[/color] crafting recipe. The default cost is 1 Iron Gear Wheel which is then multiplied by this value.
crude-transport-belt-result-cheap=Multiplies the crafted amount of Crude Transport Belts in the [color=blue]Iron Plate and Gear[/color] crafting recipe. The default amount is 1 belt which is then multiplied by this value.
crude-transport-belt-enableforce=Enabled by default. As long as this mod loads after other mods, this option should ensure that such other mods do not lock the recipes added by this mod behind any new technologies or other functions. This happens for example with the Early Extensions mod otherwise.
crude-transport-belt-enable-aaindustry=Enable or disable the [color=orange]Iron Plate and Motor[/color] recipe, disabled by default. You can activate multiple recipes if you want, they can be used alone or together. This recipe will allow you to craft Crude Transport Belts for Iron Plates and Motors (may be named differently), the same as the AAI Industry / Space Exploration recipe. The cost and craft amount can be modified with the multipliers below.
crude-transport-belt-cost-aaindustry-ironplate=Multiplies the cost of Iron Plates used in the [color=orange]Iron Plate and Motor[/color] crafting recipe. The default cost is 1 Iron Plate which is then multiplied by this value.
crude-transport-belt-cost-aaindustry-motor=Multiplies the cost of Motors used in the [color=orange]Iron Plate and Motor[/color] crafting recipe. The default cost is 1 Iron Plate which is then multiplied by this value.
crude-transport-belt-result-aaindustry=Multiplies the crafted amount of Crude Transport Belts in the [color=orange]Iron Plate and Motor[/color] crafting recipe. The default amount is 1 belt which is then multiplied by this value.
